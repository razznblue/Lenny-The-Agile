# Lenny The Agile
An obstacle-based game made with Unity using simple shapes. Making this game helped get me re-acquainted with simple Unity mechanics of game development.

## How To Play
 - The object of the game is to get from point A to point B hitting as few objects as possible along the way.
 - The player is the Blue cube named Lenny!
 - The Start and Finish markers are the two thin white rectangles in the bottom left and top right corners of the game board.
 - Everytime you hit another object, that object turns light blue, and you lose 1 point
 - If you hit an object you've hit before, you won't lose a point
 - it is quite impossible to get a perfect score but definitely possible to get 5 or fewer hits in one game.

## Types of Obstacles
 - Normal: these obstacles stay in one spot and won't move unless another object collides with them and adds a force
 - Spinning: these obstacles spin at various speeds adding an extra challenge layer to the game
 - Falling: these objects fall at certain times during the game meant to catch players by surprise
 - Rolling: these objects roll from a ramp down into the game area where the player is and can make it more challenging for the player not to hit objects
